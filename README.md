# Plugin-ExtUI

Plugin providing extra Android widgets and generic access to the Android APIs

PLEASE NOTE: Plugins built with Android Studio will only work when built in RELEASE mode. Also, you cannot install the APK in the normal fashion. It must be copied to the /DroidScript/Plugins folder on the internal sdcard and the DroidScript app restarted (an example Install.bat is included to help with this).
